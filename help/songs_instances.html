<p>The database distinguishes between <i>songs</i> and <i>song instances</i>.</p>
<p>A <i>song</i> is a unique combination of music and lyrics that we perceive as a unit.  A <i>song instance</i> is a specific version of a song.  If two songbooks include the same song, and their two versions are identical, those would count as the same song instance.  But the versions would count as <em>different</em> song instances if they differ in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Arrangement</li>
  <li>Key or time signature</li>
  <li>Additional lyrics<br/>(E.g., some versions of "Humble Yourself in the Sight of the Lord" include the lyrics to "Amazing Grace"; others don't.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The song information on the right side of the page gives details for each song instance separately.</p>
<p>Sometimes a song is printed under several different titles; the title assigned to the whole song is usually the most common one.  If two songs would otherwise have the same title, they are disambiguated by the name of the tune (e.g., "All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name (Coronation)" vs. "All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name (Diadem)") or by the name of the artist (e.g., "Thank You, Lord (Mabry)" vs. "Thank You, Lord (Jernigan)").</p>
