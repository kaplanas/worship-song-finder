<p>Use these filters to search for songs with particular key or time signatures.</p>
<p>The "Match all" option for these filters operates at the <em>instance</em> level, not the song level.  For example, if you search for both E major and E♭ major with "Match all" selected, the filter will return "In Christ Alone" because the Zoe arrangement modulates from E♭ to E &mdash; <em>within the same instance</em>.  The filter will <em>not</em> return "Abide with Me"; <i>Sacred Selections for the Church</i> prints this song in E♭ only, while <i>Praise for the Lord</i> prints it in E only.</p>
