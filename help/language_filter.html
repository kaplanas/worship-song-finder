<p>The language filter lets you search for songs written in a particular language.  Most of the songs here are in either English or Spanish, of course.  There are a handful in other languages, mostly Taizé songs.</p>
<p>Use the "Match all" option to search for songs in <em>all</em> of the languages you selected.  This could be used, for example, to search for songs that have both English and Spanish versions.  Note that this option applies "all" at the <em>song</em> level, not the instance level: it will return songs that have, say, one instance in English and another in Spanish, even though each instance uses only one language.</p>
<p>This procedure will <em>not</em> return all of the songs that could possibly be sung together in English and Spanish.  Two song instances with different lyrics are grouped into the same song only if one is (more or less) a translation of the other &mdash; e.g., "This Is the Day"/"Este Es el Día".  If two instances have the same tune but the lyrics have nothing to do with each other, they are counted as separate songs &mdash; e.g., "Iglesia de Cristo", which is set to the tune of "O Worship the King" but deals with a different topic entirely.  You can discover examples like this with the "Same tune" button in the song details.</p>
