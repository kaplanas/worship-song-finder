<p>This database catalogues scripture references in songs.  (More precisely, scripture references are linked to lyrics, but this section will refer to "songs".)  These references include direct quotes, close verbal parallels, and other allusions.  The guiding principle is <em>specificity</em>; a song is linked to a verse in scripture if it's clear that the song alludes to that verse in a relatively specific way: the author probably had that verse in mind, or the song contains a phrase or idea that could only have come from that verse (whether the author was aware of this or not).  In practice, this turns out to be surprisingly complicated; here are the guidelines for how a "specific reference" was determined:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Direct quotation:</b> Songs that quote scripture more or less word-for-word.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The easiest case is where the entire song is taken directly from scripture.  For example, "The Steadfast Love of the Lord" quotes Lamentations 3:22&ndash;24.</li>
    <li>Sometimes a phrase in the song clearly refers to a particular verse.  For example, "A New Anointing" refers to Genesis 1:1 with "In the beginning God created".</li>
    <li>Even very short phrases or individual words are recorded, as long as they refer <em>specifically</em> to one verse or a small set of verses.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Some phrases are taken from a single verse; for example, the title "Prince of Peace" occurs in Isaiah 9:6 and nowhere else.  Thus, any song that uses the phrase "Prince of Peace" is linked to Isaiah 9:6.</li>
      <li>Other phrases occur in a very small set of verses; for example, the title "Ancient of Days" occurs in Daniel 7:9, 13, 22.  Thus, songs that use the phrase "Ancient of Days" (e.g., "O Worship the King") are linked to all three verses.</li>
      <li>Other phrases occur in a large number of verses; these references are <em>not</em> recorded in the database.  For example, Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" many times; thus, it's not clear that any song that uses this phrase is referring to a specific verse (or verses) of scripture.  (Also, trying to record all those verses for every song that mentions the "Son of Man" would just be too much.)  But if a song clearly refers to a specific passage, this <em>is</em> recorded (e.g., the song "Son of Man" paraphrases Revelation 1:12&ndash;17).</li>
      <li>The boundary between "a few verses" and "many verses" is fuzzy.  If a phrase occurs in four verses, is that too many?  Five?  Six?  Seventy times seven?  This database probably isn't entirely consistent on that count in terms of which phrases/verses are indexed and which aren't.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Close verbal parallels:</b> Songs that have wording very similar to something that appears in scripture.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Some songs are close paraphrases of a sizeable section of scripture; for example, "Hallelujah, Praise Jehovah" is a paraphrase of Psalm 148.</li>
    <li>Some songs use wording very similar to passages in scripture.  For example, songs that refer to people being "white as snow" or "whiter than snow" may refer to Psalm 51:7 or Isaiah 1:18.  If a song clearly refers to just one of those verses (e.g., "Jesus Paid It All" for Isaiah 1:18, since the song also mentions sin's "crimson stain"), it's linked to that specific verse; otherwise, it's linked to both.</li>
    <li>A song may use wording from a verse in a very different sense from its original context.  For example, songs such as "The Lily of the Valley" allude to Song of Solomon 2:1, even though the phrase "lily of the valley" does not refer to Jesus in its original context.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Other allusions:</b> Songs that clearly allude to some portion of scripture, even if they don't use similar wording.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Many songs allude to stories in scripture, especially events in the life of Jesus.  Such songs are linked to these stories, as specifically as possible &mdash; that is, the database indexes only those specific parts of the story that are actually alluded to in the song.</li>
    <li>For stories that occur in more than one gospel, the database indexes all occurrences of the story, even if the song is clearly using one gospel's version of the story as opposed to another.</li>
    <li>Some songs refer to a theological concept that is introduced in a very specific place in scripture.  For example, songs that refer to Jesus as "High Priest" are linked to a handful of verses in Hebrews (or a subset thereof, if it's clear that the song is referring to a specific passage).</li>
    <li>Some songs refer to a theological concept that occurs in many places in scripture; these are <em>not</em> recorded in this database.  For example, for songs about forgiveness, you would want to do a topic search rather than a scripture reference search.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this filter is to make it easier to find songs that are related to particular scriptures.  This does <em>not</em> mean, though, that every song listed with a given scripture is necessarily appropriate for a lesson based on that scripture.  There are several reasons to proceed with caution:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The song may be based on the whole verse or only a small part of it.  At one extreme, the song may quote the entire verse; at the other extreme, the song may have just a single phrase from the verse (e.g., "King of Kings").</li>
  <li>The portion of the song that refers to the verse may be large or small.  The database doesn't distinguish between cases where the whole song is based on the verse vs. cases where just one phrase in the song refers to the verse.  If you're looking for the former, you can try combining a scripture reference search with the "Scripture paraphrase" or "Scripture quotation" topics.</li>
  <li>The portion of the song that refers to the scripture may not even be familiar to us.  Scripture references are compiled for the <em>full</em> version of each song; this includes verses or sections that we never sing because they aren't in our songbooks.  This is especially true for older songs, which often have many verses that aren't printed in our books.  Even some newer songs may be known to us only in part; for example, some of the shorter new songs that we sing are actually just the refrain of a longer song.<br/>To find the full versions of older songs, <a href="http://www.hymnary.org/" style="color: blue">hymnary.org</a> and <a href="http://www.hymntime.com/tch/" style="color: blue">The Cyber Hymnal</a> are good resources.  For newer songs, try Google!</li>
  <li>Sometimes only a particular version of the song includes a certain reference.  For example, "Create in Me" is linked to Psalm 119:105 because some groups add "Thy Word" as a descant.</li>
  <li>All of the scripture references were coded by hand.  Every attempt has been made to be thorough, but the catalogue necessarily reflects human biases and imperfect memory.  For example, there are no songs linked to the book of Obadiah &mdash; but I wasn't looking very hard, and I might not have recognized a reference to Obadiah even if I saw one.</li>
