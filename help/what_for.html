<p>This site is an interface to a database of Christian hymns and other worship songs.  It's intended to help people discover (or remember) just the right song for a particular purpose.  You can use this site to ask questions like...</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some songs about submission in <i>Songs of Faith and Praise</i>?</li>
  <li>What are some songs that refer to chapter 40 of Isaiah?</li>
  <li>What songs has Randy Gill written?</li>
  <li>What songs from <i>Praise for the Lord</i> have Spanish translations?</li>
  <li>I want to start a service with "We're Marching to Zion".  Is there another call to worship song in the key of G that we could sing next, in a medley?</li>
  <li>My group wants to sing "Thou Art Merciful, O Father", but we don't know the tune.  Is there a familiar tune with the same meter that we could use instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, some of this information is available in other places too.  Many songbooks, for example, list songs by topic, meter, etc.  The goal of this site is to supplement those guides by being:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Comprehensive:</b> The database contains all the songs from popular hymnbooks such as <i>Songs of Faith and Praise</i> and <i>Praise for the Lord</i> &mdash; side by side with the catalogues of Zoe, Hallal, and Praise &amp; Harmony.</li>
  <li><b>Flexible:</b> You can search for songs with several characteristics at once, without cross-referencing different indices.  For example: "What's a song about repentance in a minor key that isn't arranged as a solo?"</li>
  <li><b>Specifically designed for Churches of Christ:</b> There are excellent sites like <a href="http://www.hymnary.org/" style="color: blue">hymnary.org</a> with tens of thousands of hymns from a variety of traditions.  But if you're a worship leader deciding what to sing next Sunday, you might find it helpful to focus on songs that your congregation is more likely to know (and that already have a cappella arrangements).</li>
