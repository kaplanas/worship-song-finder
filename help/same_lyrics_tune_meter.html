<p>The song details panel on the right side of the page includes three buttons: "Same lyrics", "Same tune", and "Same meter".  Clicking on one of these buttons clears the filters and returns a list of songs that have the same lyrics, tune, or meter as the song you're looking at.</p>
<p>"Same lyrics" returns songs that share the same lyrics, including translations.  This is useful for finding songs that have the same lyrics set to different tunes.</p>
<p>"Same tune" returns songs that share the same tune.  As noted under "The language filter", this is useful for finding English and Spanish songs set to the same tune, even when neither set of lyrics is a translation of the other.</p>
<p>"Same meter" returns songs that share the same meter.  This is useful for finding other tunes that you could use with a given set of lyrics, or vice versa.  If you do this, you'll of course want to use good judgment and common sense; it's generally not possible to take just any song from this list and switch the lyrics or tunes with the song you're interested in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A given song may be associated with more than one meter through its lyrics, tune, or both (see "The meter filter").  The "Same meter" button returns all songs that match <em>any</em> of the meters associated with the song you're looking at.  If you want to match just one part of a song, you may want to use the meter filter to narrow your search further.</li>
  <li>The meter notation doesn't distinguish between songs with different stress patterns.  For example, most songs in 8.7.8.7 (D), such as "What a Friend We Have in Jesus", have an alternating stressed&ndash;unstressed pattern that starts with a stressed syllable.  But a handful, such as "How Deep the Father's Love" and "What Child Is This?", start with an <em>unstressed</em> syllable.  This means that even though "What a Friend We Have in Jesus" and "How Deep the Father's Love" are coded the same way, their lyrics and tunes aren't actually interchangeable.</li>
  <li>Plenty of lyrics&ndash;tune pairs just aren't appropriate.  It's <em>possible</em> to sing "'Tis Midnight, and on Olive's Brow" to the tune of "Our God, He Is Alive", or "O Sacred Head" to "I'll Live in Glory" &mdash; but not recommended!</li>
