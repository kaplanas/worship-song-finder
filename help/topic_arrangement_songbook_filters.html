<p>Use the topic filter to search for songs about a particular subject.  The "Match all" option searches for songs that have <em>all</em> of the topics you selected.</p>
<p>The arrangement type filter lets you search based on various properties a particular arrangement might have.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Alternating voices:</b> Two or more groups of voices sing in an alternating pattern.<br/>Examples: "Our God, He Is Alive"; "O Listen to Our Wondrous Story"; "Listen to Our Hearts"</li>
  <li><b>Canon:</b> One group of voices starts later, repeating the same melody.<br/>Examples: "Love, Love, Love, Love"; "Rejoice in the Lord Always"</li>
  <li><b>Chant:</b> No fixed meter for part of the song; a measure lasts as long as it takes to sing the phrase associated with it.<br/>Example: "By Christ Redeemed, in Christ Restored", printed as a chant in some books (<i>Praise for the Lord</i>) and with meter in others (<i>Songs of Faith and Praise</i>)</li>
  <li><b>Echo:</b> One group of voices repeats exactly what another sings, in an alternating pattern.<br/>Examples: "I Will Call upon the Lord"; "You're Worthy of My Praise"; "Deep Calls to Deep"</li>
  <li><b>Four parts:</b> Sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses each have a distinct melody; voices are usually added one at a time.<br/>Examples: "The Greatest Commands"; "Magnificat"</li>
  <li><b>Fugue:</b> Each voice enters in sequence, beginning with the same melody but quickly branching off into something different.<br/>Example: "Lo, What a Glorious Sight"</li>
  <li><b>Leader:</b> The arrangement requires a leader who sings something different from the soprano line.<br/>Examples: "Victory Chant"; "Angels Watching over Me"</li>
  <li><b>Men lead:</b> Male voices sing the melody with female voices following (possibly with a different melodic line).<br/>Examples: "Have You Seen Jesus My Lord?"; "Lord, I Lift Your Name on High"</li>
  <li><b>Other polyphony:</b> Any kind of polyphony that doesn't fall into one of the other categories.<br/>Examples: "Why Did My Savior Come to Earth?"; "O Lord, Our Lord"</li>
  <li><b>Solo:</b> One voice sings the melody while others sing "ooh", "hmm", or some other meaningless syllable.<br/>Examples: "Arise, My Love"; "Rabboni!"</li>
  <li><b>Soprano/alto/tenor/bass lead:</b> One voice sings the melody while the other voices accompany with different words and/or rhythm.<br/>Example: "Sing and Be Happy" (alto lead)</li>
  <li><b>Two parts:</b> The song has two distinct melodies which are sung separately and then together, usually with voices trading parts.<br/>Example: "You Are My All in All"</li>
  <li><b>Women/men only:</b> Part of the song involves either women or men singing alone.<br/>Examples: "Angry Words"; "Great Are You, Lord"</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Include" option returns songs where at least one instance has one of the arrangement types you selected.  The "Exclude" option returns songs where at least one instance does <em>not</em> have any of the arrangement types you selected.  For example, to find a song for congregational singing, you might want to exclude solo arrangements.  This setting would <em>not</em> return "Arise, My Love", because there are no purely congregational arrangements of that song in the database.  But it <em>would</em> return "The Heart of Worship"; the Zoe arrangement of this song involves a solo, but the Hallal and TPH arrangements do not.</p>
<p>The songbook filter lets you search for songs from a particular source.  "Songbooks" include traditional hymnbooks such as <i>Songs of Faith and Praise</i> and the catalogues of groups like Zoe, plus a few additional sources.  The songbooks included in this database are as follows:</p>
