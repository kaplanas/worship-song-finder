<p>The goal of recording the meter is to make it easier to find lyrics and tunes that can be put together in new ways.  There are at least two reasons you might want to do this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes, singing a familiar set of lyrics to a different tune can help us hear the words with fresh ears.  Try "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross" to the tune of "Before the Throne of God Above", or the verses of "Living for Jesus" to the tune of "Be Thou My Vision".</li>
  <li>You might have a song that you want to sing because the lyrics are perfect for the occasion, but your group doesn't know the tune and there isn't time to learn it.  If the lyrics are in a popular meter, you can find a tune you already know to use instead.  For example, Barton W. Stone's "Come, My Christian Friends and Brethren" is a poem about Christian unity; it's set to "Love Divine" in TPH, but if your congregation isn't familiar with that tune, you could use "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing" instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>This database uses a variation of traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(hymn)" style="color: blue">hymn meter</a> notation.  Count the number of syllables in each line and join the counts with periods; for example, "Amazing Grace" is 8.6.8.6:</p>
<table class="meterIllustration" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <tr><td>Amazing grace!  How sweet the sound</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>that saved a wretch like me!</td><td/><td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>I once was lost but now am found,</td><td/><td>8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>was blind but now I see.</td><td/><td>6</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Use "D" to indicate a pattern repeated twice.  For example, "O Sacred Head" is 7.6.7.6 D:</p>
<table class="meterIllustration" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <tr><td>O sacred head, now wounded,</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>with grief and shame weighed down,</td><td/><td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>now scornfully surrounded</td><td/><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>with thorns thine only crown,</td><td/><td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>how art thou pale with anguish,</td><td/><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>with sore abuse and scorn!</td><td/><td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>How doth that visage languish</td><td/><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>that once was bright as morn!</td><td/><td>6</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This database deviates from traditional practices in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>A set of lyrics can have multiple meters.</b>  Traditionally, each set of lyrics is coded with the meter of the verse; if there's a refrain, "R" is added at the end.  For example, "Lead Me to Calvary" would be 8.6.8.6 R.  But sometimes the refrain has its own meter; the refrain of "Lead Me to Calvary", for example, is 8.8.8.6.  In this database, "Lead Me to Calvary" is coded with 8.6.8.6 <em>and</em> 8.8.8.6.</li>
  <li><b>Meter is coded for lyrics and tunes independently.</b>  Usually, of course, the meter of the lyrics is the same as the meter of the tune.  But there are some cases where it's useful to code them differently:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A single tune might fit more than one meter.  For example, ELLACOMBE is set with "Hosanna, Loud Hosanna" (7.6.7.6 D) and "I Sing the Mighty Power of God" (8.6.8.6 D).  The tune is coded as 8.6.8.6 D in this database &mdash; but because lyrics are coded separately, it's also associated with 7.6.7.6 D.</li>
    <li>The verses and refrain of a set of lyrics might combine to produce a meter that's worth coding separately.  For example, the verses of "Lamb of God" are 8.8.8.8, and so they could be sung to other 8.8.8.8 songs such as "Lord, Speak to Me".  The refrain is <em>also</em> 8.8.8.8; this means that the entire verse + refrain melody of "Lamb of God" is 8.8.8.8 D, and could fit with 8.8.8.8 D lyrics such as "In Christ Alone".  In this database, the lyrics of "Lamb of God" are coded as 8.8.8.8; the tune is coded as 8.8.8.8 D.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Anything that remotely resembles a meter is coded, not just the popular meters.</b>  The result is a bit messy; you'll notice that there are a lot of options listed in the meter filter.  But the payoff is that it's a little easier to discover fortuitous matches.  For example, "As a Tree beside the Water" is unlikely to be familiar to most congregations.  But the verse <em>and</em> the refrain match the verse and refrain of "All to Jesus I Surrender"; the verse is in a popular meter (8.7.8.7), but the refrain is not (5.5.8.5).</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, you'll want to use caution and common sense if you're looking for new lyrics/tune combinations.  See the "Same lyrics/tune/meter" help topic for more.</p>
